            temperament: 'The personality of these parrots is predominantly docile and gentle. Like many other parrots, the African Grey depends on social stimulation and interaction with humans and other birds. Because of their impressive intelligence, though, these parrots might need it even more than your ordinary pet bird! If neglected, your pet can become bored, mischievous, and unhappy. This can subsequently lead to the development of health issues. You’ll have to keep in mind that their remarkable intelligence requires an outlet. Provide this outlet alongside plenty of care, and it will ensure you have a healthy and happy pet parrot.',
            diet: 'The African Grey Congo diet is varied and needs to be nutritious and filled with necessary vitamins and minerals. The standard seed mix for large parrots will provide a stable base source of nutrients but should be combined with regular additions of fresh fruits and vegetables, like apples, oranges, bananas and plums, as well as cucumbers, corn, carrots, zucchini, and tomatoes. They will love a bit of fresh greens, holding it in their foot as they munch and crunch with a healthy appetite.\n' +
            'Offer your pet African Grey an occasional bath and regularly changed fresh water. Provide them with plenty of space and toys so they won’t grow bored and unhappy. You can also let them out of the cage once in a while, but make sure all the doors and windows are closed beforehand.',
            housing: 'African Grey Congos are medium-sized parrots, and their length reaches around 13 inches on average. They do boast a broad wingspan of up to 20 inches, so make certain they have a lot of room to stretch out! Although not too large in length, they are still pretty robust and can weigh up to 1 lbs on average. These parrots can have an amazing lifespan of around 50 to 60, even 70 years as a cared for and healthy pet bird. This longevity makes them an excellent choice for a companion parrot, and they often share a deep bond and a significant portion of their lives with their owners.',

            health: 'As a robust and exotic parrot, the African Grey will need looking after. In optimal conditions with sufficient care, problems shouldn’t occur, but with their great lifespan, issues are bound to happen. Be on the lookout for the classic signs that something is out of the ordinary: ruffled feathers, loss of appetite and general apathy, difficult breathing or sagging wings. Another common issue that can occur is feather picking. This is a direct result of insufficient attention, loneliness, and overall poor interaction.'

Don’t hesitate to open the cage up and let them fly around the room for a bit, perhaps while you take care of the hygiene of their cage – another important aspect to remember. Of course, it goes without saying that during your parakeet’s time outside, all windows and doors should be closed and no other pets should be present in the room.',
